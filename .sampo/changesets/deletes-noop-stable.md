Promote the four remaining delete operations from experimental to stable by making an already-deleted resource a documented no-op: `webhooks.delete`, `sequences.delete`, and `abtest.delete` now report `deleted: false` instead of surfacing not-found errors on repeats, and `templates.delete` distinguishes Listmonk's shared "non-existent or default template" rejection so only a genuinely missing template becomes a no-op while the protected default template still fails explicitly. The webhook and sequence delete outputs make the echoed record optional when nothing was deleted. The stable TypeScript contract count rises from 71 to 75.
