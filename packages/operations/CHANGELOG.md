### Patch changes

- Updated dependencies: openapi@0.4.2

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-28

### Added

- [2117c34](https://github.com/imjlk/listmonk-ops/commit/2117c342c0415c1f75d9a323dc9c5f665f4f962b) Expand operation specs with high-risk email operation descriptors, a typed safe-start playbook, and compiler-enforced migration coverage. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-28

### Added

- [5578960](https://github.com/imjlk/listmonk-ops/commit/557896096810d21701f49834a46a6c9b6dbbd6b7) Add a compiler-driven Email Operations Specification with Typia-generated normalized contracts, effect-derived safety policies, agent guidance, catalog projection, and graph-enforced pilot bindings for campaign get/schedule and subscriber blocklist. — Thanks @imjlk!

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- [a5ed6de](https://github.com/imjlk/listmonk-ops/commit/a5ed6de7344256139d32a363f82e8a1c196e85b8) Add optional `idempotency_key` to the transactional send operation.
  
  When a key is supplied, the wrapper atomically claims an idempotency record
  before dispatch. Identical retries replay the original result instead of
  re-sending; a different payload under the same key is rejected as a conflict.
  Ambiguous transport failures (timeout, connection reset) leave an `unknown`
  record that blocks automatic retry **for the TTL window** (24 hours by
  default). After the TTL expires the record is swept and the same key can be
  claimed again, so operators must reconcile within that window or supply a
  fresh key.
  
  The send output is extended to `{ sent, status, duplicate?, idempotency_key?, expires_at? }`
  where `status` is `"accepted" | "replayed" | "failed"`. The store path defaults
  to `~/.listmonk-ops/transactional.json` and is overridable via
  `LISTMONK_OPS_TRANSACTIONAL_STORE`.
  
  `@listmonk-ops/common` now exports the file-backed idempotency store
  (`createFileBackedTransactionalIdempotencyStore`), the SHA-256 payload
  hasher (`hashTransactionalPayload`), and the target-namespace helper
  (`computeTransactionalTargetHash`) that the CLI and MCP adapters inject. — Thanks @imjlk!

### Patch changes

- Updated dependencies: openapi@0.4.1

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-27

### Added

- [05c99bc](https://github.com/imjlk/listmonk-ops/commit/05c99bca9bf9213124e60b14ab83b288962bf9a8) Add campaign lifecycle, subscriber bulk, transactional hardening, and media upload operations.
  
  Campaign lifecycle (6 new operations): schedule, start, pause, cancel, clone, stats. A new `campaign-lifecycle.ts` state machine rejects obviously invalid transitions before they reach Listmonk's status endpoint. `clone` copies body/lists/template under a new name and resets runtime fields.
  
  Subscriber bulk (4 new operations): add-to-lists, remove-from-lists, blocklist, unblocklist. The new `subscriber-bulk.ts` executor chunks subscriber IDs (default 500, fail-fast by default, optional continue-on-error) and supports dry-run and max-items cap.
  
  Transactional hardening: tighten recipient validation to exactly one of subscriber_email or subscriber_id (XOR), reject header values that smuggle CR/LF/NUL or other control characters, and block reserved transport headers.
  
  Media upload (1 new operation): upload media from base64-encoded contents with a MIME allowlist and a 10 MiB size cap. CLI `media upload --file <path>` reads via Bun.file and encodes the bytes.
  
  OpenAPI contract cleanup: extract CampaignOperations, SubscriberOperations, and MediaOperations into named interfaces mirroring TemplateOperations so the public types no longer rely on anonymous intersections. — Thanks @imjlk!
